"""Question: Howrah Bridge Traffic Status - 
Write a program to determine traffic status on Howrah Bridge based on time and vehicle count.

Input: Take hour (0-23) and vehicle count as input.
Output: Print traffic status: ""Light"", ""Moderate"", or ""Heavy""
Logic:
If hour is between 7-10 or 17-20 (rush hours) -> if vehicles are greater than 500, 
then traffic status is ""Heavy"", else it is ""Moderate""
If it is (non-rush hours) and the vehicles count is greater than 300, then traffic status is ""Moderate"", 
else it is ""Light""

Note - Refer the solution if you can't understand the question."""


hour = int(input(" enter hour(0-23)"))
vehicle = int(input("enter no. of vehicle: "))
if(hour>=7 and hour<10) or (hour>=17 and hour<=20):
    if(vehicle >=500):
        print(" traffic is heavy ")
    else:
        print("moderate")

else:

    if(vehicle>=300):
        print("moderate")

    else:
        print("light")
